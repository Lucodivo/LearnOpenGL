TODOs:
- Figure out how to properly order when drawing the transparent cubes (and their sides)
	- Remember to turn off back culling when verifying
- Break out input processing. Remove circular dependency between main and PlaygroundScene
- Test sending texture width/height data as a uniform to see if we get more accurate pixel by pixel image kernels
- Create a 5x5 kernel fragment shader
- Implement zoom for camera
