TODOs:
- Figure out how to properly order when drawing the transparent cubes (and their sides)
	- Remember to turn off back culling when verifying
- Break out input processing. Remove circular dependency between main and PlaygroundScene
- Move PlaygroundScene::loadTexture() into separate file for more general use
